Check out Second Helping! An award winning app that connects restaurants and activists to help fight hunger by donating extra food at the end of the day to the needy! 

1st Place Winner: Access Code Mobile Hackathon 3.3

Worked as Design Lead on a team of four to create an Android application that connects restaurant owners to volunteers for charity. Restaurant owners can make a post on the app to signal there is food to be picked up. Volunteers can claim the listing, pick up the unsold food, and bring it to one of the charity locations listed on the map.

• Implemented an intuitive UI/UX utilizing animations and adhering to Google Material Design principles

• Dual user flow depending on whether signed in as a business or volunteer. 

• Implemented the Google Maps API, Firebase, background and notification services, SQLite, Cupboard, and Retrofit to set up notification interaction between restaurant owners and users.
